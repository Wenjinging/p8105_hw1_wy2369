# Problem 1

### Load the `penguins` dataset 

Here is the code shown below:
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### A short description of the dataset

First of all, here are **8** important variables in the dataset which are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and year. 


The size of the dataset:
```{r}
nrow(penguins)
```

```{r}
ncol(penguins)
```
The data frame has `r nrow(penguins)` rows, and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. 


Working on the mean flipper length:
```{r}
Mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The mean is equal to `r Mean`.
