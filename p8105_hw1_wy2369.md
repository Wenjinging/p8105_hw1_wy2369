# Problem 1

### Load the `penguins` dataset

Here is the code shown below:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Write a short description

``` r
summary(penguins)
```

    ##       species          island    bill_length_mm  bill_depth_mm  
    ##  Adelie   :152   Biscoe   :168   Min.   :32.10   Min.   :13.10  
    ##  Chinstrap: 68   Dream    :124   1st Qu.:39.23   1st Qu.:15.60  
    ##  Gentoo   :124   Torgersen: 52   Median :44.45   Median :17.30  
    ##                                  Mean   :43.92   Mean   :17.15  
    ##                                  3rd Qu.:48.50   3rd Qu.:18.70  
    ##                                  Max.   :59.60   Max.   :21.50  
    ##                                  NA's   :2       NA's   :2      
    ##  flipper_length_mm  body_mass_g       sex           year     
    ##  Min.   :172.0     Min.   :2700   female:165   Min.   :2007  
    ##  1st Qu.:190.0     1st Qu.:3550   male  :168   1st Qu.:2007  
    ##  Median :197.0     Median :4050   NA's  : 11   Median :2008  
    ##  Mean   :200.9     Mean   :4202                Mean   :2008  
    ##  3rd Qu.:213.0     3rd Qu.:4750                3rd Qu.:2009  
    ##  Max.   :231.0     Max.   :6300                Max.   :2009  
    ##  NA's   :2         NA's   :2

There are **8** important variables in the dataset which are **species,
island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g,
sex, and year**.

``` r
nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

The data frame has **344** rows, and **8** columns.

``` r
Mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean of filpper length is equal to **200.9152047**.

### Make a scatterplot using `ggplot`

Here is the code to make the scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs
bill_length_mm (x) and color by three species:

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins,aes(x = bill_length_mm,y = flipper_length_mm,color = species)) + geom_point()
```

The scatterplot looks good and we save it using `ggsave`:

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot_hw1.pdf")
```

# Problem 2

### Create a data frame

Load the `tidyverse` and make dataframe:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
p2_df = tibble(
  vec_df = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_df > 0,
  vec_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("small","small","small","medium","medium","medium","large","large","large","small"))
)
```

### Take the mean value

Use the `pull` function to take the mean of each variable in my
dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df,vec_df))
```

    ## [1] 0.3743314

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df,vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df,vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

For `vec_df` and `vec_logical`, the mean value can be determined.
However, the mean output of `vec_char` and `vec_factor` are NA because
they are not numeric or logical variables.

### Convert the variables

Apply the `as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and factor
variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p2_df,vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df,vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df,vec_factor))
```

### Explain what happen and why

Using the code chunk, logical variable is converted to number (1 or 0),
which represents TURE or FALSE. Also factor variable can be converted to
number. The default ordering is alphabetical, which means “high” is
assigned to be 1, “medium” is 2, and “small” is 3. Because of that,
logical and factor variables can take the mean.

However the character variable cannot calculate mean value, because it
cannot be converted to numeric variable successfully. Using
`as. numeric` code, the mean value of character vector is still NA.
