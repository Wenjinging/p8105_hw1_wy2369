# Problem 1

### Load the `penguins` dataset

Here is the code shown below:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### A short description of the dataset

First of all, here are **8** important variables in the dataset which
are **species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm,
body_mass_g, sex, and year**.

``` r
nrow(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 344

``` r
ncol(penguins)
```

    ## [1] 8

The data frame has **344** rows, and **8** columns.

``` r
Mean = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean of filpper length is equal to **200.9152047**.

### A scatterplot using `ggplot`

Here is the code to make the scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs
bill_length_mm (x) and color by three species:

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins,aes(x = bill_length_mm,y = flipper_length_mm,color = species)) + geom_point()
```

The scatterplot looks good and we save it using `ggsave`:

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot_hw1.pdf")
```

# Problem 2

### Create a data frame

Load the `tidyverse` and make dataframe:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
p2_df = tibble(
  vec_df = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_df > 0,
  vec_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("small","small","small","medium","medium","medium","large","large","large","small"))
)
```

### Take the mean value

Use the `pull` function to take the mean of each variable in my
dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df,vec_df))
```

    ## [1] -0.268049

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df,vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df,vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

For `vec_df` and `vec_logical`, the mean value can be determined.
However, the mean output of `vec_char` and `vec_factor` are NA because
they are not numeric or logical variables.

### Convert the variables

Apply the `as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and factor
variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p2_df,vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df,vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df,vec_factor))
```

Using the code chunk, logical and factor variables are converted to
numeric variables, and can take the mean. However the character variable
cannot be converted.
